To compile, place all three files in the same directory, then run:
dafny fileiotest.dfy fileionative.cs

which should print something like
Dafny 2.1.1.10209

Dafny program verifier finished with 4 verified, 0 errors
Compiled program written to fileiotest.cs
Compiled assembly into fileiotest.exe

Then you can run the program (I use mono since I'm on unix):
mono fileiotest.exe
