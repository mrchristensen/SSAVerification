Overview of the whole TLS Process and what to verify

1. before connecting to host, must call:
    SSL_library_init();
	OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms();
	ERR_load_BIO_strings();
	ERR_load_crypto_strings();
	SSL_load_error_strings();
    - all done in server_create()
2. ssl_ctx_new(method) // do we need to validate anything about the method - no, it's always SSLv23
    check that it didn't return null
    done in tls_opts_create --> called in socket_cb and set_certificate_chain
3. SSL_CTX_set_verify()
4. SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations() must return 1
5. make SSL* object with ssl_new(), make sure it doesn't return null
    SSA does this in tls_wrapper in tls_client_setup and tls_server_setup
6. make sure the ssl_ctx used in previous step is freed with ssl_ctx_free
    done in SSA in tls_opts_free function in tls_wrapper
7. SSL_set_tlsext_host_name(tls, hostname) - set server name indication for client hello
8. SSL_set_fd() --> associate socket with tls context
9. ssl_connect(tls) != 1
10. cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(tls) to get certificate, should not return null  
    validate_hostname(hostname, cert) --> all in hostname validation C file

To validate hostname:
1. hostname and cert can't be null
2. 




calling socket(), then connect()
